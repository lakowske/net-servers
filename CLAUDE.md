# Clean Python Project Template

## Project Purpose
This is a template for creating clean, professional Python projects that incorporate industry best practices from the start. It serves as a foundation for new Python projects with all the essential development tools and quality assurance measures pre-configured.

## Clean Code Practices Implemented

### Code Quality & Standards
- **Black** - Automatic code formatting with 88 character line length
- **Flake8** - Comprehensive linting with Google docstring conventions
- **Pre-commit hooks** - Automated quality checks before every commit

### Testing & Coverage
- **Pytest** - Modern testing framework with proper project structure
- **Coverage reporting** - Minimum 80% code coverage required
- **HTML coverage reports** - Generated in `htmlcov/` directory
- **Integration testing** - Structured test organization

### Git Workflow
- **Pre-commit configuration** - Ensures code quality on every commit
- **Automated checks** for:
  - Trailing whitespace removal
  - End-of-file fixing
  - YAML validation
  - Large file detection
  - Code formatting (Black)
  - Linting (Flake8)
  - Test coverage (Pytest with 80% minimum)

## Project Structure
```
clean-python/
├── actions/          # Project build and automation scripts
├── tests/           # Test suite with pytest configuration
├── build/           # Build artifacts (auto-generated)
├── htmlcov/         # HTML coverage reports
├── .pre-commit-config.yaml  # Pre-commit hook configuration
├── .flake8          # Flake8 linting configuration
├── setup.cfg        # Project metadata and configuration
└── requirements.txt # Project dependencies
```

## Development Commands
- `pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=80 --cov-report=html` - Run tests with coverage
- `black .` - Format code
- `flake8` - Run linting
- `pre-commit install` - Install pre-commit hooks
- `pre-commit run --all-files` - Run all pre-commit checks

## Quality Gates
Every commit must pass:
1. Code formatting (Black)
2. Linting checks (Flake8)
3. All tests passing
4. Minimum 80% code coverage
5. No trailing whitespace
6. Proper file endings
7. Valid YAML syntax

This template ensures that code quality, testing, and documentation standards are maintained throughout the development lifecycle.

## Commit Message Guidelines

- Use clear, concise commit messages that describe the change
- Do not include AI assistant attribution or advertising in commit messages
- Focus on the "why" rather than the "what" in commit descriptions
